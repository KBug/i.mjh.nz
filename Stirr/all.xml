    <title>Walk-Ins Welcome with Bridget Phetasy</title>
    <desc>Helen Joyce, author of Trans: When Ideology Meets Reality, sits down with Bridget for an in-depth conversation about the trans activist movement, what inspired her to write the book, what's changed since the book came out in 2021, the bullshit idea that everything can be blamed on feminism, the detransitioners she's met, and how the trans movement is sending womens rights back to the dark ages. They discuss the sense that women have been abandoned in the culture wars, queer theory, the rise of conspiratorial thinking, how much faith she used to have in the institutions of our society and why she no longer trusts them, the definition of a moral injury, how gender ideology breaks things in exactly the place they're meant to work, being told that its a civil right to choose your gender, why she feels she's doing exactly what shes supposed to be doing, and why you should never validate the delusion because you will lose control of the ward.</desc>
