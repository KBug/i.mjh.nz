    <title>Walk-Ins Welcome with Bridget Phetasy</title>
    <desc>Bridget sits down with Noam Blum, Chief Technology Officer at Tablet magazine, for a conversation about the Israel/Palestine conflict. They discuss the atmosphere of rhetoric inflation that allows more people to speak with blatant antisemitism, ever more extreme language getting a continuous pass in progressivism, how the language of academia seems divorced from the language of the people, and seeing a lot of disillusionment and feelings of isolation among people as they react to the conflict. They cover how the people who have spent the last several years telling others to stay in their lane are now willing to lecture you about Israel and antisemitism, Noam's prediction of the cultural backlash we'll see in the next few years, how word definitions are widened due to rhetoric inflation because youre not going to turn a lot of heads by using milder words, the actual definition of the term "settler," why antisemitism is being seen as second degree bigotry and always has to be paired with Islamophobia, resenting the necessity of having to immerse yourselves in gore and horror because the alternative is for people to say it didnt happen, why you shouldnt be able to make money off of war porn, and why you should never take a newly released hostages statement at face value. Check out Noam's podcast Ambitious Crossover Attempt  for more discussion of this topic.</desc>

    <title>Off The Vine with Kaitlyn Bristowe</title>
    <desc>The #1 question Kaitlyn gets asked (hands down) is, How do you manifest? Well, Chris Corsini is back on the pod today to explain exactly how to manifest, or as he calls it, "co-create with the universe." It's literal magic, and don't let someone with no abracadabra tell you there's no such thing as magic. Chris also pulls tarot cards for the group to see what we're walking into and letting go of for this Fall Equinox. These messages really resonated with KB, so let us know in the comments if they resonated with you too. There are about 16 months left with Aries in the North node, so make sure you're taking full advantage of it! Don't know what a node is? That's okay! Kaitlyn didn't either... There's so much to learn about the universe, so buckle up because we're only getting started!</desc>
